## Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a classic 2-player game played on a 
grid, where players alternate marking spaces with 'X' or 'O'. The goal is to be the first to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It is a solved game; optimal play from both sides always results in a draw.
